# 🐶 TinDog – Bootstrap Practice Project

TinDog is a **fun, responsive landing page** created purely for **hands-on practice with Bootstrap**.  
This project helped me understand how Bootstrap components, grid systems, and responsive utilities work together in a real webpage.

The idea is inspired by a fictional concept — **“Tinder for Dogs”** 🐕💙 — and is used only as a frontend learning exercise.
